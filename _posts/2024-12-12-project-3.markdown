description: From April 2019 to May 2023, I worked on a PhD dissertation to explore how to monitor waterlogging in agriculture from space and to understand its impact on soil health and crop productivity. This journey resulted in a profound personal transformation, four peer-reviewed articles, and <a href="https://pure.tudelft.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/150384414/dissertation_den_besten.pdf">a dissertation</a> supervised by Dr. Richard de Jeu, Prof. Susan Steele-Dunne, and Prof. Pieter van der Zaag.
