description: Our local water resources are managed in cooperation with neighbors, a practice that is very common in rural Spain. However, the water quality needs to be monitored, and the size of the aquifer needs to be evaluated. This is essential to safeguard water use for future generations and to encourage sustainable local water management in Asturias. We have taken on the role of mapping and understanding our springs and aquifer to better comprehend their dynamics, size, and quality.
