The COVID pandemic sparked a profound personal transformation, leading me to embrace a life closer to nature. Living simply in a garden house during lockdown taught me how little I truly need and how much joy comes from growing and building with my own hands. This journey brought me to Asturias, Spain, where, with my partner Iñaki, we’ve found a community of like-minded individuals who share a vision of sustainable living. Together, we’ve created Yerbes Salvaxes, a project centered on cultivating a self-sufficient, locally sustained life that benefits both the environment and others. By living this way, we hope to inspire personal change as a pathway to meaningful global impact.

#Ever since COVID, it became very clear to me that living closer to nature is all I need. During the confinement, I lived in a garden house in a communal garden in the Netherlands—a very simple shed with a homemade rainwater system and a pellet stove. I spent almost two years living in this garden house, even enduring several weeks of -15°C weather. Inside, it was always warm and cozy. This experience made me realize how little I truly need and how much joy I feel when I have space to grow and build. It was clear to me that I needed to find a place in nature to continue this lifestyle <:> building a food forest, a small shed, and fully immersing myself in nature.

#One day, I decided to leave the Netherlands and drive southward to visit a friend working at a campsite in the South of France. I initially booked a stay for ten days, but those ten days turned into five months. At the campsite, I met many like-minded people, and one of them stole my heart. His name is Iñaki Cabo Ibarzabal, an intriguing Basque with countless stories about his adventurous life filled with travel and learning. Interestingly, Iñaki had a similar vision for his life<:> to live close to nature, grow a large portion of his own food, and start an agricultural project with a small Airbnb. Before we knew it, we were looking for places together to make this shared dream a reality.

#Iñaki proposed we search in Asturias, northern Spain. I had never been there, so we decided to rent an apartment and live there for a few months. I fell in love again—this time with the region. Asturias is an incredible province with a remarkably diverse landscape. You can lose yourself in the vast mountain ranges and wander endlessly along the rugged coastline. It’s a perfect place for nature lovers who would rather explore new hiking routes every weekend than try out the latest bar in Amsterdam. It was clear we had found the right place.

#After 1.5 years of searching for a home, we stumbled upon a renovated old farmhouse with a piece of land and several additional buildings for creative projects. Since October 2023, we have been proud residents of Bimenes, a municipality where the population has been decreasing over the past few decades. Fortunately, we are surrounded by a wonderful community of old hippies, punks, and people we call “Neo-Rurales.” These Neo-Rurales are like-minded individuals who chose to live rurally and closer to nature rather than being trapped in a hectic city life with a burdensome mortgage.

#While renovating parts of the house, preparing the land, and hiking, we work remotely to finance our dream. We havve named our Earthship and project Yerbes Selvaxes, which means “Wild Herbs” in the Asturian language. With Yerbes Selvaxes, we aim to create a locally sustained life, consuming, producing, and building with resources from our area. We also want to make space to work on projects we care about and believe benefit the environment and our fellow beings, rather than working solely for money. We believe if everybody would commit to this lifestyle, the world would be a much happier place.

#Yerbes Selvaxes currently consists of a house, an apartment for rent (under construction), a workshop, a vegetable garden, and a small food forest. In 2025, we hope to finish the apartment and plant more trees to further enhance our self-sustainability.
